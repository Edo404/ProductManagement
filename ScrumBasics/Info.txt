-----SCRUM-----

--Problems to solve

Impossible to know how the project is gonna develop

Agile: spirito di adattamento alla situazione
Scrum: divisione degli obiettivi in piccoli obiettivi minori

Agile Manifesto revolution from Waterfall that was not good in software development because
it's impossible to know everything is going to happen.

- Work with business partners throughout a project
- Measure success using completed software
- Allow teams to self organize

Fail FAST = Learn FAST

Scrum as guardrails, not straight but it gives you the directions
- Short cycles (2 weeks) to develop and test solutions, allowing for regular feedback and adjustments.
