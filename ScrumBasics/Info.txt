-----SCRUM-----

--Problems to solve

Impossible to know how the project is gonna develop

Agile: spirito di adattamento alla situazione
Scrum: divisione degli obiettivi in piccoli obiettivi minori

Agile Manifesto revolution from Waterfall that was not good in software development because
it's impossible to know everything is going to happen.

- Work with business partners throughout a project
- Measure success using completed software
- Allow teams to self organize

Fail FAST = Learn FAST

Scrum as guardrails, not straight but it gives you the directions
- Short cycles (2 weeks) to develop and test solutions, allowing for regular feedback and adjustments.

--Framework

Waterfall: Time, Cost, Scope
Agile: the SCOPE is the only thing that is no locked
Scrum: Product Owner + Scrum Master, Daily Standup + Retrospective

Product Owner (PO):
- Business representative
- Reviews team Work
- Ensure highest value
- Interacts with stakeholders
- Maintains the product vision

Scrum Master:
- Protects Team and Process
- Keeps team working in peace
- Acts as spokesperson for the team
- Helps remove roadblocks
- Holds team accountable to PO


- Collaboration, in the same room or Video conferencing

Team composition:
- 7 +- 2 members
- T-shaped skills, vertical one and horizontal one
- Norms: when laptop should use in meeting, agree/disagree with task


-- Ready to Work 

MVP - minimum viable product
- Fast feedback loop
- Reduces scope creep

Decomposition:
- Identify themes (profile, order, payment..)
    trigger the idea, group works for efficient 
- Break themes for efficient features (login, security for the profile theme)

User story:
INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
As a <User Role> I want <User requirement> so that <desired benefit>

AC - acceptance criteria
- customer name is captured and save
- customer email and password are captured and save

Team Boundaries:
- definition done (minimum requirement for all the stories)
- backlog refinement
- sprint cadence (1-4 weeks, fail and learn fast)

Actual estimate: specific, 30 km from A to B (how long it takes)
Relative estimate: Giraffe twice tall than a zebra (estimate, Maintains mindset)

Roadmap: order to work between all the themes
Release plan: high level plan roadmap + sprint


-- Down to work

Sprint planning meeting: 
- Devs, PO, ScrumMaster
- Understand the story
- Post definition of done
- Plan for questions
at the end of each sprint

Information radiators:
Task Boards:
- Task per story
Sprint Burndown Chart:
- sprint execution

Daily Standup:
- Collaboration
- Communication
- cadence

Backlog changes:
refinement sessions calls
