Challenge 1: influencing without authority - present data to support your idea
Challenge 2: prioritization - utilizing quantitative and qualitative data
Challenge 3: managing multiple stakeholders - communicate clearly and regularly
Challenge 4: budget constraints - ensure what you are working on is gonna deliver positive business outcome

- Massive scale
- Established markets
- Focus on ROI


---Lifecycle---

- Phase0: Define business outcome
- Phase1: Discover - pain points
- Phase2: Validate - determinate right solutions
- Phase3: Build - engineers and designers
- Phase4: Launch - marketing
- Phase5: Evaluate
- Phase6: Iterate - how can improve


- Increase retention, Reduce costs, Gain market share
- Leverage meaningful quantitative and qualitative data to understand customer pain and
challenges
- Can easily pressure test ideas with customers using in-app prompts and surveys
- Proactively communicate priorities using a product roadmap that is shared and 
accessible across the organization
- Engage users with in-app launch campaigns and ongoing education to drive adoption
- Combine product usage data with business data to understand a feature's success and impact
- Iterate quickly and often, creating a continuous loop of product innovation and improvement

---Understanding problems---

Why do they want this feature?
What are we trying to accomplish by doing this?
Is the solution we're thinking of actually the right way to solve the problem?
Could we solve the problem in a different way that's better for more users?

- Understand problem
- Identify solution

What does the workflow of our core user look like?
What do our successfully retained users do in the product?
Where do users we don't retain drop out of the product?
What are customers actually trying to accomplish?

Data
Helps illuminate if and how people are using your product, which features they do and 
don't engage with, where users drop out of key workflows, and what different segments of
users do differently.

What features do retained customers engage with the most?
Do you see usage patterns in the rest of your user base?
Where did users who churned drop out of workflows?

The process of gathering and analyzing information about software users to gain insights 
into their behaviors, needs, motivations, and preferences.

Also referred to as exploratory research, product managers usually conduct this during the 
discovery phase to get the lay of the land and gain a contextual understanding of their users.
- User interviews
- User surveys
- Card sorting 

What do customers want us to build and why?
Are users doing what we expect in the product? If not, why?
Where do different types of users fall off?

What do power users do differently?


---Finding solution---

The closer you get to being right the first time, the less developer resources
you waste and the faster you achieve your business outcome.

Validation
The process of gathering evidence and verifying whether an idea for a product or feature meets
the desired objectives and fulfills users' needs.

What outcomes are resonating most with customers?
How can we best solve for our customers' pain?
What don't we know about customers' workflows that may help in building the solution?
How do we curate a diverse set of customers for interviews?
What pain is so deep that customers would pay for a solution?

- Helps you prioritize which solutions to build
- Helps teams invest resources in the right areas of the product
- Helps you better manage stakeholders

How to validate product ideas:
Product usage data
In-app surveys or polls
Market research and surveys
Willingness to pay surveys
Feedback management platform

Happens up front before building anything, e.g. with prototype or usability testing
Fake door test: Inviting customers to use a feature that isn't released yet to see how many of them are interested in it

Putting things into the product to see how they work 
Making functionality available to a small subset of your user base before going into a deeper build
A/B test: Putting out two versions of a feature and seeing which performs better

- Choose the right type of experiment
- Target right user
- Use data to evaluate success


---Delivering continuous value---

- Waterfall (80% testing 20% release)
- Agile (sprint e release x2)
- Continuous delivery (release, new functionality, bug fix, updates) 

Outlines what capabilities need to be included in a release so that design and development teams
know what they need to design and build

Document key project information
Note your objective
Include any assumptions
Link to relevant user stories
Include relevant design information

- Product manager
- Product designer
- Engineers

With Engineers:
Prioritize what gets built
Ensure alignment with vision
Communicate pivots in direction
Help them be self-sufficient

Epic
A body of work that can be broken down into specific tasks, based on the needs
of customers and end users.

- Communicate the why
- Be decisive
- Learn how engineers do best work
- Clarify responsibility
- Invest in relationship

With Product designers:
- Clarify requirements
- Provide feedback
- Serve as the bridge for other teams
- Collect customer feedback

A visual method for outlining the work requirements that will achieve the best end-user experience
As a [type of user] , I want to [action] so that [benefit]

- Get designer involved
- Explain reasons behind decisions
- Respect visions
- Create ongoing feedback loops
- Foster effective communication

Socialize your roadmap and explain the "why" behind what you're building
Sales: How will this new feature make it easier for them to sell the product?
Customer support: How might what you ºre building help drive down support tickets
and calls? Is it solving a common instance of user friction?
Leadership: How will the new product or feature impact business outcomes like customer retention or revenue?

Create a single source of truth for the roadmap that teams can access on their own
- For leadership
- For your customer
- For internal teams


---Launch---

An iterative approach to releasing products and features requires 
continuous, coordinated launches

How can I make sure users know about a new feature?
How do I ensure readiness internally across the company?
How do I educate users on the value of new functionality?
How can I help users adopt a new feature?

- Size of the release
- Relevance
- Desired action

External:
Announce the release to current users
Include in content marketing, social media, conference announcements, PR, demand
generation, sales enablement

Internal:
Ensure customer and prospect-facing teams know what you're releasing
Enable teams to explain and answer questions about new functionality

Feature flags:
Turning features on and off during a release

Opt-in:
Giving users the ability to opt into trying a new feature

Pilot program:
Having a group of users try out a product or feature for a set period of time

1% or 10% tests:
Testing new functionality with a certain percentage of your user base

- Set launch goals
- Build segments
- Track product usage post-launch

Bring launch announcements in-app
Target communications to the right users
Indicate the next action users should take
Use product data to measure success


---Evaluate---

Tracking and analyzing quantitative product usage data
Continuing to collect qualitative data

Are users finding and trying this improvement?
Are we meeting adoption goals?
Where are users getting stuck?
What qualitative feedback are we receiving?

- Adoption rate
- Feature use and engagement
- Conversion rate

Paths
Funnels
Session reply

User surveys
User interviews
In app feedback

Customer support
Social media
Customer sentiment


---Iterate---

How can we improve the product experience?
Do we need to tweak our goals or focus?
Should we double down on what's really working?
Are R&D teams working on the right projects?
Is this moving us closer to achieving our business goal?

Most new features and products require at least some iteration

- Build time into your roadmap for iteration
- Set expectations upfront with your manager about the metric you're trying to
