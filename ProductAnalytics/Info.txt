-----Product Analytics-----

---Introduction---
Process of capturing and analyzing how users interact with the product

Tool that captures and exposes usage patterns from digital products (web mobile app)

- Uncovers insights about software users
- Enables data-driven decision making
- Allows product teams to understand the ROI of their work
- Fuels growth and rapid experimentation and iteration
- Helps drive successful digital transformation

Software capabilities:
- Teams can track and report users behavior
- Allows to enroll multiple data points to dashboard

Actions:
- Determine if your company has a way to track user behavior
- Think how your team could benefit from product analytics and dedicated product analytics tool


---Strategy---

Setting Goals:
- Understand engagement: how user is using my product , is using the feature?
- Facilitate Conversation with Stakeholders: data makes conversation easier

Goals of analytics:
- Build right products and features
- Reduce friction
- Increase revenues
- Drive more innovation

10 questions:
- How many active users I have today/last week/ last month?
- How do users use my product?
- Which feature is more used?
- Are users finding important parts of the product easily?

- Usage of key features is increasing or decreasing over time?
- Which features and pages cause problems?
- Which features and pages users ignore? 

- How frequently user are going back in the product?
- How many users continue using the product after first months?
- How many users who interact with the features come back?

Metrics:
Standard of measurements by which efficiency, performance, progress, 
or quality of a product can be assessed

Business Outcomes - How product impact financial Outcomes
Product usage - How users behave inside the product
Product quality - How the product is going instead of how it is supposed to do

Lagging Indicators - Metrics that are healthy for business but the results arrive in long term (customer renewals)
Leading Indicators - Metrics measurable in short term, high probability to affect Lagging (monthly active users)

- Specific
- Measurable
- Actionable
- Relevant
- Timely

OKRs - What are we focused on now? 
KPIs - Are we ok?
One Metric That Matters - Does what we're working on contribute to this metric?
North Star Metric - Does what we're working on contribute to our primary metric?
Check Metrics - Will focusing on this metrics create downsides?

Product Analytics strategy best practices:
- Start with your goals
- Don't create your analytics strategy in a silo
- Invest in data management
- Establish naming convention
- Enable entire organization with analytics
- Integrate analytics data with the rest of the business

Your core team, the most contentious people, leadership, partners and other teams
Re-examine your product analytics strategy once a year

Qualitative data:
Quantitative + Qualitative (Ex. usage - quantitative, feedback - qualitative)
Use quantitative data to identify people from whom you then want to collect qualitative data
Cross reference qualitative feedback with quantitative usage data from those users and accounts


---Framework---

Prioritization:
Also for prioritization, data analytics important to guide your decisions
- Collect data
- Refine data in metrics
- Build metrics in reports 
- Take action
- Data Actualization

Collect data:
- Information about people who use product (visitors, accounts)
- Information about people behavior (events, clicks, page loads)

- Finding right data
- Making sure you can access
- Getting that into a tool to analyze

Refine data in metrics:
- Breadth: how many users
- Depth: how much of the product are customers using
- Frequency: how often users log in 

Challenge 1 - which metrics to use
Challenge 2 - different people = different interpretation of same metrics
Challenge 3 - get people across business to agree on metrics

- Identify stakeholders
- Define goals of product
- Invite stakeholders to collaborate on product
- Create plan to analyze 

Build metrics in reports:
Establish tables and graphs to describe user behavior
- Allows to see metrics fluctuate over time
- Identify areas for improvements 

- Path: sequence of events and actions
- Funnel: sequence of steps by features
- Retention: percentage of users that are using on a time period the product

Take actions:
Analysis
- Review data
- Ask questions
- Build hypotheses
- Try to find answers

Dashboards
- Collection of reports and widgets

Storytelling
- Most data benefit from a story
- Many product teams deliver insights in a slide deck

Data actualization:
- Accurate and clean actionable data
- Ability to ask and answer harder questions
- Learn on 'gut feel' only in particular situations


---In Practice---

Aha moments
When customer recognize distinct value of your product
(Ex. Facebook, when a user connected to > 10 users in < 7 days)
- What are most valuable features
- Which features are aha moments

Defining what success look like
- Year long retention
- Week 2 retention
- Users recommending product
- Users inviting users 
- Users becoming NPS

Prioritization of team's work
- Prioritize feature requested based on product usage
- Cross-reference feedback and request with usage

Measuring success of new features
If users are interacting with the new feature
- Improve adoption for users who have already engaged with a feature
- Increase adoption for users who haven't engaged with a feature

Taking actions
- Increase visibility of the feature
- Improve adoption so more users are aware of the feature
- Make improvements on the feature

Identify friction
Friction: anything gets in the way of a user's ability to achieve
their objective or job to be done

- User dropping out workflows with Funnel and Session Replay
- Low usage of key features with feedback
- Support ticket topics with usage data

Sunsetting features
The most strategic move your team can make is sometimes to
remove a feature from the user interface or retire products

- More streamlined user experience
- Increased efficiency

- Low and dwindling feature usage over time
- New features that replace older functionalities
- Feedback

Step 1: Understand product usage
Step 2: Dig into engagement
Step 3: Look at different segment of the user base
Step 4: Leverage feedback to understand the why
Step 5: Monitor the impact

Internal communications
- Make sure team knows about sunset
- Communicate timelines

External communications
- Give advance notice of sunset
- Provide education on alternatives to utilize
- Any necessary migration instructions


---Make business case---

Instead of determining the right features to build, product leaders are tasked
with making decisions that tie to overall business strategy

Business case
Document that describes the why of any piece of work
- Investing in the usability of the product
- Investing in innovation
- Where to focus your adoption efforts

- Who is the target audience
- What pain is this addressing?
- What is the desired outcome?

- Revenues
- Cost
- Risk


---Best practices---

- Lacking visibility into product usage
- Relying on manual and inefficient ways to get product data
- Having no way to understand what drives churn, retention, or growth

Startups:
- Find product-market fit
- Learn about your early users and their behavior
- Develop a minimum viable product (MVP)

Medium:
- Scale more efficiently
- Improve your product
- Increase retention and conversion and decrease churn

Big:
- Improve your product so that you stay competitive
- Connect data from multiple sources across your business

- Choose a product analytics tool that is designed for your product
- Choose a product analytics tool that best serves the consumer of your data
- Choose a product analytics tool that aligns with the type of software 
you're building and how it's used

- A user-friendly interface
- Codeless instrumentation
- The ability to connect data to other systems
- Integrations with other tools in your tech stack
- The ability to correlate with qualitative feedback

Buyer stakeholders
Leaders from various teams who should be
brought along throughout the purchase process

User stakeholders
The teams and contributors who will be able
to leverage this new tool to do their jobs better

- Drive revenue
- Reduce costs
- Mitigate risk

Revenue
Understanding how customers use the product enables you to give
them more of what they want, which leads to happier, long-term
customers-and more of them

Cost
A product analytics solution is more efficient than what your team
could do on its own

Risk
Knowing what types of users are engaging with certain areas
of your product helps you make better decisions around what to
build or iterate on, which leads to higher adoption and retention
