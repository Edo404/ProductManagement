-- Project Management

A project is a temporary endeavor with a unique goal and usually a budget.
Projects have a definite beginning and end, unlike day-to-day operations.
The goal of a project is to produce a unique result, such as a product, service, or other outcome.
Projects often face constraints, including budgets and resource availability.

Project management involves applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to achieve project objectives.
Key questions to answer in project management include:
- What problem are you solving?
- How are you going to solve it?
- What's your plan for getting the project done?
- How can you tell when you're done?
- How well did the project go?

Clearly defining objectives, requirements, and deliverables is crucial for project success.

Project managers need technical skills specific to project management, such as building project plans, schedules, and measuring performance.
Business expertise is crucial to ensure the project delivers value and aligns with the organization's goals.
Problem-solving skills are essential as projects rarely go according to plan.
Interpersonal skills are vital for leading diverse teams and ensuring effective collaboration.
Strong leadership is the most important characteristic, inspiring and motivating the team to achieve project success.
